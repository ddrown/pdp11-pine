# PDP-11 / 2.11BSD size reduction TODO

Goal: shrink pine to fit a PDP-11 address space. Target environment: no
TCP/IP, purely local mbox mail, outgoing delivery via local sendmail
(sm_unix). Current x86-64 debug build is 1.7MB; stripped/optimized text+data
is still ~970KB, way over budget.

Completed cuts and fixes have their detailed write-ups split out into
`TODO-pdp11-done.md` (same repo directory) to keep this file focused on
what's still open; check there for history/rationale on anything marked
DONE elsewhere or referenced in passing below.
